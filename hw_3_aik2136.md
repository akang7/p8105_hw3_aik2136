Problem 1
---------

This problem uses the BRFSS data. First, do some data cleaning:

-   Format the data to use appropriate variable names;
-   Focus on the “Overall Health” topic
-   Include only responses from “Excellent” to “Poor”
-   Organize responses as a factor taking levels ordered from “Excellent” to “Poor”

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)

brfss_data = brfss_smart2010 %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  rename(state = locationabbr, county = locationdesc) %>% 
  filter(topic == "Overall Health") %>% 
  select(-class, -topic, -question, -sample_size, -(confidence_limit_low:geo_location)) %>% 
  mutate(response = factor(response, levels = c("Excellent", "Very Good", "Good", "Fair", "Poor"))) 
```

In 2002, which states were observed at 7 locations?

``` r
brfss_data_2002 = brfss_data %>%
  filter(year == "2002") %>%
  group_by(state) %>% 
  summarize(n_locations = n_distinct(county)) %>% 
  filter(n_locations == "7")
```

Make a “spaghetti plot” that shows the number of locations in each state from 2002 to 2010.

``` r
brfss_data %>% 
  group_by(state, year) %>% 
  summarize(n_locations = n()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = n_locations, color = state)) +
  labs(
    title = "Spaghetti plot of number of locations in each state from 2002 - 2012",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Number of locations") +
  geom_line() +
  viridis::scale_color_viridis(discrete = TRUE) +
  theme(legend.position = "right")
```
